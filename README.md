## what it is

tide is a **standalone desktop client for music — from anywhere you can stream it**. native Qt6 — not an Electron skin. it sits on top of `mpv`, talks to YouTube Music via `ytmusicapi`, resolves streams via `yt-dlp`, reads your local files via `mutagen`, and renders everything in IBM Plex with monochrome + an accent color you can let the album cover dictate.

it was designed for one thing: to be **the music app that has a sense of itself**. no shipped defaults are middle-of-the-road. brutalist-mono ships as the default; if you don't like brutalism, swap themes from a dropdown — same app, completely different personality.

## sources (v1.2)

press `Ctrl+8` for the `[source]` panel — every source is one toggle away.

| | tag | search | library | requires |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **youtube music** | `[YT]` | ✓ | ✓ | cookie import |
| **soundcloud** | `[SC]` | ✓ | — | nothing |
| **bandcamp** | `[BC]` | ✓ | — | nothing |
| **mixcloud** | `[MC]` | ✓ | — | nothing |
| **local files** | `[LO]` | ✓ | ✓ (by album) | a music directory |
| spotify | `[SP]` | v1.2.1 | v1.2.1 | premium |
| apple music | `[AM]` | v1.2.2 | v1.2.2 | apple id |

queue is source-agnostic. mix a YT Music search, a Bandcamp deep cut, and a local FLAC in the same queue — tide dispatches each to the right backend. **federated search** mode (toggle in the source panel) runs every enabled source in parallel and tags each result row so you can see where the hit came from.

## features

### playback

- search the YouTube Music catalog (your account or anonymous)
- your **library + playlists** (liked songs first)
- **queue + radio autoplay** — when the queue ends, tide pulls a continuous radio seeded from the last track
- **lyrics** — plain from YT Music, **synced** via LRClib fallback (active line bolds + auto-scrolls)
- **drag-to-reorder queue**, sleep timer (Ctrl+I), like button (Ctrl+H), history view, mini-mode (Ctrl+M)
- **resume on launch** — quit mid-song, relaunch, picks up paused at the same position

<sub>synced lyrics via LRClib fallback — active line bolds + auto-scrolls</sub>

</div>

### discovery (Ctrl+6)

- YT Music's home shelves rendered as horizontal card rows
- artist detail (top songs + albums + singles + related)
- album detail (cover + tracklist + play all / shuffle)
- search filter tabs: `[songs] [videos] [albums] [artists]`

<div align="center">

</div>

### look & feel

- **11 themes**, each with its own personality:

  | | font | case | controls | accent |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **brutalist-mono** (default) | IBM Plex Mono | lowercase | `[play]` | amber `#d4b95e` |
  | gruvbox | IBM Plex Mono | lowercase | `[play]` | mustard |
  | terminal-green | IBM Plex Mono | UPPERCASE | `[play]` | CRT green |
  | solarized-light | IBM Plex Mono | normal | text | blue |
  | paper | IBM Plex Sans | normal | text | crimson |
  | nord | IBM Plex Sans | normal | ▶ | frost |
  | catppuccin | IBM Plex Sans | normal | ▶ | pink |
  | rose-pine | IBM Plex Sans | normal | ▶ | rose |
  | ambient | IBM Plex Sans | normal | ▶ | lavender |
  | synthwave | IBM Plex Sans | **`L33T`** | ▶ | neon magenta + cyan |
  | adaptive | IBM Plex Sans | normal | ▶ | follows current album art |

<div align="center">

<tr>
<td><img src="assets/screenshots/theme1.png" alt="theme variant 1" width="300" /></td>
<td><img src="assets/screenshots/theme2.png" alt="theme variant 2" width="300" /></td>
<td><img src="assets/screenshots/theme3.png" alt="theme variant 3" width="300" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<sub>same app, three themes</sub>

</div>

- **4 layout presets**: `classic`, `focused`, `dj-deck`, `walkman` (portrait phone-shape) — each swaps widget variants (progress style, volume style, album-art shape, controls size, label arrangement)
- **adaptive accent** — opt-in toggle that animates the theme accent toward the current cover's dominant color
- **adaptive central-area gradient** — optional companion to adaptive accent; tints the main content area with a soft vertical gradient pulled from the album palette, retinting per track
- **per-theme text case** — synthwave renders `H3110 W0R1D`, terminal-green renders `ALL CAPS`, brutalist stays lowercase
- **3 bundled fonts** — IBM Plex Mono, JetBrains Mono, Inter — plus a font picker that overrides any theme's typography (accepts arbitrary system family names)
- **themed nav icons** — bundled brutalist SVG line-art (recolored to the active theme's `fg`), classic mono glyphs, or emoji

### motion & feel  *(new in v1.2.0.1)*

- **motion intensity** — `off` / `lite` (default — signature + everyday animations) / `full` (everything including atmospheric). respects `QT_REDUCED_MOTION` and clamps `full` to `lite` when set.
- **track-change signature** — title decodes left-to-right from random block glyphs while the album art crossfades; layered on top of the existing 1.5s adaptive accent fade for a triple-timeline reveal.
- **playback speed** — popover with `−0.05` / `+0.05` nudges, preset buttons (`0.5× 0.75× 1.0× 1.25× 1.5× 2.0×`), and a reset. Pitch-shifted by default for the slowed-and-reverb / nightcore vibe; toggle "preserve pitch" in settings for audiobook use. Shortcuts: `[` slow · `]` fast · `\` reset.
- **UI scale** — `compact (0.85×) / normal / large (1.15×) / huge (1.30×)`. cascades through every fixed-size widget (track row, album art, cards, album/artist pages, view margins).
- **soft corners** — `sharp` / `soft (6px)` / `rounded (12px)` applies a sticky `@radius` override on inputs, scrollbars, and the central-area clip.
- **customizable loading bar** — five styles in the status bar tracking the resolve → buffer → playing window: `off`, `numbers`, `blocks`, `dots`, `ascii`.
- **stream-URL prefetch** — once a track has ≤15s remaining, tide pre-resolves the next one. auto-advance is ~instant on cache hit; silent fallback to normal resolve on miss.

### audio visualizer (Ctrl+7, F11 for fullscreen)

9 theme-aware renderers driven by a PipeWire monitor capture + numpy FFT pipeline:

- `bars-mono` `▁▂▃▅▆▇█` — for mono themes
- `bars-filled` — gradient rectangles, sans themes
- `oscilloscope` — waveform line + halo (ambient)
- `neon-grid` — synthwave perspective grid + spectrum bars
- `circle-burst` — radial 360° spectrum
- `mirror-bars` — symmetric VU-style EQ
- `dot-matrix` — pixelated reactive grid (brutalist)
- `starfield` — particles flying toward camera, bass-driven speed
- `matrix-rain` — cascading characters

in-canvas `⚙` cog overrides renderer + audio source on the fly.

</div>

### system integration

- **MPRIS2** over QtDBus — media keys, KDE Plasma & GNOME panel controls, lockscreen art
- **Discord rich presence** — opt-in, shows `0:34 / 3:42` progress with current track + album cover (you bring your own Discord app ID)
- **ListenBrainz scrobbling** — opt-in, paste your user token
- **system tray** (KDE/GNOME) — hide-to-tray on close, full controls in the tray menu
- **daily update check** — toast when a newer release lands on GitHub

## install

### arch linux (everything is in `extra`)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/captiencelovesarch/tide.git
cd tide
makepkg -si
```

tide ends up at `/usr/bin/tide`. desktop launcher + icon get installed for KDE/GNOME menus. when AUR registrations reopen, `yay -S tide` will work too.

### sign in

on first launch, tide opens a small dialog: open YT Music in your browser, sign in normally, click **`[import]`** in tide. tide reads the cookies straight out of your chromium-family browser (decrypting via your kwallet/libsecret key) and you're in.

supported browsers: Chromium, Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge. **OAuth doesn't work** for YT Music as of 2024 — Google blocks WEB_REMIX endpoints for OAuth-bearer tokens — so cookie import is the only working path.

### other linux distros

not officially supported, but doable:

```sh
sudo apt install python3 mpv libmpv-dev fonts-ibm-plex   # debian/ubuntu equivalent
pip install --user pyside6 ytmusicapi yt-dlp python-mpv cryptography pypresence numpy sounddevice secretstorage
git clone https://github.com/captiencelovesarch/tide.git
cd tide && PYTHONPATH=src python -m tide
```

no desktop launcher, no auto-icons. tested only on arch.

### macOS / Windows

probably possible, untested, doesn't make sense without MPRIS / kwallet / parec. you'd be in port-the-app territory.

## keyboard shortcuts

| key | action |
